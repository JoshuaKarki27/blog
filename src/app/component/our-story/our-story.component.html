    Large is the place for peopleâ€™s tales and thoughts. It started as a project meant to
    give me experience designing a web application with Angular and Firebase using

    <em>Through this project, I have a much deeper understanding of the MVC architecture, Data Binding,

  </p>
  <p class="description">
